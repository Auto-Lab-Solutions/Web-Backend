# Firebase Configuration for Development Environment
# Copy this file to firebase-development.conf and customize the settings
# This file controls Firebase integration for the development environment

# Enable or disable Firebase notifications
# Set to "true" to enable Firebase push notifications
# Set to "false" to disable Firebase (default for development)
FIREBASE_ENABLED=false

# Firebase Project ID (required if FIREBASE_ENABLED=true)
# Get this from your Firebase Console
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=""

# Firebase Service Account Key (required if FIREBASE_ENABLED=true)
# This should be the base64-encoded JSON service account key
# To generate: cat firebase-service-account.json | base64 | tr -d '\n'
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=""

# Configuration Notes:
# - Development environment has Firebase DISABLED by default for simpler deployment
# - To enable Firebase for development:
#   1. Copy this file to firebase-development.conf
#   2. Set FIREBASE_ENABLED=true
#   3. Set FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID to your Firebase project ID
#   4. Set FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY to your base64-encoded service account JSON
# - Environment variables (ENABLE_FIREBASE_NOTIFICATIONS, etc.) will override these settings
# - The actual config file (firebase-development.conf) should not be committed to git
